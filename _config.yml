          Building an AI-powered language learning app that captures words from your daily life
        description: |
          Creating a mobile app that captures words and phrases from your environment (menus,
          signs, conversations) and turns them into personalized spaced-repetition flashcards.

          **What I'm learning:**
          - End-to-end product development (discovery → design → build → test)
          - GenAI integration (OCR, translation APIs, prompt engineering)
          - Mobile-first UX for language learners
          - Go-to-market strategy for consumer apps

          Part of hands-on upskilling through VibeCoding Lisboa's product community.

      Board member and saxophonist in a Lisbon-based big band—handling everything from
      concert logistics to community building. I help my family's toy shop back in the
      Netherlands with digital marketing and inventory systems.

      Recently walked part of the Camino de Santiago (Portuguese route) before settling
      in Lisbon. Always up for live music, trail hiking, and conversations about how
      products actually get built (and adopted).
